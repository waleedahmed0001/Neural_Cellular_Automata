# Neural_Cellular_Automata
In this work, we employ neural cellular automata (NCA) to classify histopathological images of colorectal cancer patients. Our NCA classifier not only exceeds all benchmarks(CNN based models) reported in the original MedMNIST paper [2] but also outperforms the CNN model and matches the performance of the best model from the MedMNIST v2 paper.
